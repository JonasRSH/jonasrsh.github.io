            <li>Capoeira
                <p>Capoeira is a unique Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, music, and culture.
                    Capoeira is characterized by its fluid, rhythmic movements and the use of kicks, spins, and flips, all performed
                    in a circular formation known as the "roda". Capoeira is not only a physical practice but also a way of live.
